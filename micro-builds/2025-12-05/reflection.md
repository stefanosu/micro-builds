## Reflection — 2025-12-05

Note: This was the setup day for the Log Filter Tool micro-build. I outlined the goal, command structure, and why this build matters. I will complete the implementation tomorrow and fill in the full reflection after finishing the work.


**What did I build?**



**What surprised me or tripped me up?**



**What clicked today?**



**If I revisited this in a week, what would I improve or extend?**



**How would this change in another language I use (C#, TS/Node, Ruby)?**
