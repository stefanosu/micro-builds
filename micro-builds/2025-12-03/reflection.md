## Reflection — 2025-12-03

**What did I build?**
I built a cli tool.


**What surprised me or tripped me up?**


**What did I learn or reinforce about file I/O or parsing?**


**If I revisited this in a week, what would I improve or extend?**


**How would this change in another language I use (C#, TS/Node, Ruby)?**
