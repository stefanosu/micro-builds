# micro-builds

A daily collection of small, focused programming projects designed to sharpen my fundamentals, improve code quality, and deepen my understanding of real-world software concepts.  

Each micro-build is intentionally scoped to be completed in 15–45 minutes and emphasizes:
- Clear problem-solving  
- Clean code  
- Practical skills (parsing, data structures, HTTP, CLI tools, etc.)  
- Iteration and reflection  

This repo represents my commitment to becoming a stronger, more fluent, and more curious developer through consistent, deliberate practice.

## 🧱 Structure

The repository is organized by date:

micro-builds/
YYYY-MM-DD/
build_name.ext
reflection.md


Each folder contains:
- **The micro-build code**
- **A short reflection** documenting what I learned, what surprised me, and what I'd improve

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project exists to:
- Strengthen everyday programming fundamentals  
- Build fluency across languages and system layers  
- Explore new concepts without pressure or perfectionism  
- Develop habits of consistency, clarity, and craftsmanship  
- Create a real record of my growth as an engineer  

Small daily reps → big long-term gains.

## 🚀 Daily Practice Framework

Every day includes:

1. **Micro-build (10–45 min)**  
   A small real-world utility, data structure, algorithm, or system component.

2. **Reflection (3–6 sentences)**  
   What I learned, what surprised me, and what I'd revisit.

3. **Commit the work**  
   Progress over perfection.

## 🗂️ Example Micro-Build Themes

Some categories included in this repo:

- File I/O and text parsing  
- Custom data structures (LRU cache, priority queue, etc.)  
- HTTP servers and routing primitives  
- Tiny CLI tools  
- Rate limiters and caching layers  
- Language internals (async/await, events, etc.)  
- Exploratory builds (toy interpreters, mini compilers)  
- Utility libraries and system “slices”

## 📅 Starting Date

**December 1st, 2025** — new month, new level.  
Consistent builds from here forward.

## 🧠 Why Micro-Builds?

Large projects teach architecture.  
Micro-builds teach **clarity, fundamentals, confidence, and fluency** — the foundation of great engineering.

This repo is where I:
- Experiment
- Explore
- Build from first principles
- Make mistakes
- Learn quickly
- Become better every day

---

## 🔥 Long-Term Vision

As the repo grows, I plan to:
- Revisit and refactor earlier builds  
- Add automated tests to selected micro-builds  
- Rewrite complex ones from scratch as skill benchmarks  
- Expand into lower-level or more advanced system concepts  
- Track progress over weeks and months

This is an evolving personal lab.
